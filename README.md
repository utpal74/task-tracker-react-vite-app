# Task tracker or note saver call what you like, is a simple app built using react and vite in vanilla Javascript.

You can use this app to take a small note, note down tasks to be done, mark done or not done, edit, update and delete based on your need.
As of this moment, this app does not store any data on server. It uses browser to store the data locally.
